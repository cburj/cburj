Developed in Larvel in only 6 months, this project was recognised by the British Computer Society (Manchester) as "Best Project" for the University of Salford's School of Sience, Engineering and Environment.
* VIMBIUS - a lightweight collection of utilities designed to help people get to grips with VIM. Contains a large amount of company-specific functions.
* FORGE - a simple VIM plugin that allows the building of projects without the need to leave your current file.

## Upcoming Projects:
* Diddly - an open-source application for small independent businesses, helping them to manage their online and traditional orders. Diddly aims to also help with the more complex tasks, such as choosing appropriate packaging and retrieving the best shipping costs.
