## About Me

Hi! I'm Charlie. I'm currently a final year student studying Computer Science. I have just finished my placement year as a software engineer - using C to develop back-end code for warehousing software.
I tend to commit most of projects to private repositories, as there is a lot of messy code that I don't think people on the internet should be learning from. The projects you will find on my GitHub account are the projects that I feel people might find a use for, rather than just random side-projects.
I also have over 5+ Years experience doing freelance 3D Design and Art, mainly using Cinema4D and Fusion360 for rendering and modelling.
